# web-monitoring-versionista-scraper

This is a version of [versionista-outputter](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter) that has been rewritten in Node.js and JSDom.

Why? Speed is important here. Scraping Versionista can take a *long* time. We don’t need the overhead of a browser (like loading and executing images, CSS, and JavaScript) because all the necessary content is in the inital HTML payload. Parallelizing operations is also a little easier (for me, at least) in Node than in Ruby—and we absolutely ought to be doing more in parallel.


## Installation

You’ll need Node.js. Then you should be able to globally install this with:

```sh
$ npm install -g https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-versionista-scraper.git
```

Then run it like so:

```sh
$ scrape-versionista --email EMAIL --password PASSWORD --after '2017-03-22' --format csv --output './scrape/versions.csv'
```

You can also split output into multiple files (by site) with the `--group-by-site` option:

```sh
$ scrape-versionista --email EMAIL --password PASSWORD --after '2017-03-22' --format csv --output './scrape/versions.csv' --group-by-site
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repo, then:

```sh
$ yarn install
# Or if you don't have yarn:
$ npm install

# And run it:
$ ./bin/scrape-versionista --email EMAIL --password PASSWORD --after '2017-03-22' --format csv --output './scrape/versions.csv'
```


## Usage

This has the same basic capabilities as `versionista-outputter`, but can also save the versioned HTML (and diffs).

For basic info:

```sh
$ scrape-versionista --help
```

### Options

- `--email STRING` **Required!** The E-mail address of Versionista Account. You can also use an env var instead: `VERSIONISTA_EMAIL`

- `--password STRING` **Required!** The password of Versionista Account. You can also use an env var instead: `VERSIONISTA_PASSWORD`

- `--after DATE|HOURS` Only check versions captured after this date. It can be an ISO 8601 date string like `2017-03-01T00:00:00Z` or a number, representing hours before the current time.

- `--before DATE|HOURS` Only check versions captured before this date. It can be an ISO 8601 date string like `2017-03-01T00:00:00Z` or a number, representing hours before the current time.

- `--format FORMAT` The output format. One of: `csv`, `json`, `json-stream`. [default: `json`]

- `--output FILEPATH` Write output to this file instead of directly to your console on stdout.

- `--save-content` If set, the raw HTML of each captured version will also be saved. Files are written to the working directory or, if `--output` is specified, the same directory as the output file.

- `--save-diffs` If set, the HTML of diffs between a version and its previous version will also be saved. Files are written to the working directory or, if `--output` is specified, the same directory as the output file.

- `--latest-version-only` If set, only the latest version (of the versions matching --after/--before times) for each page is captured.

- `--group-by-site` If set, a separate output file will be generated for each site. Files are placed in the same directory as `--output`, so the actual filename specified in `--output` will never be created.


## Examples

ALL the options!

```sh
$ scrape-versionista --email 'somebody@somewhere.com' --password somepassword --after '2017-02-01' --before '2017-03-01' --format csv --output './scrape/versions.csv' --save-content --save-diffs
```

Use environment variables for credentials:

```sh
$ export VERSIONISTA_EMAIL='somebody@somewhere.com'
$ export VERSIONISTA_PASSWORD=somepassword
$ scrape-versionista --after '2017-02-01' --before '2017-03-01' --format csv --output './scrape/versions.csv' --save-content --save-diffs
```

Specifying time as hours ago instead of a date:

```sh
# Starting 5 hours ago
$ scrape-versionista --after 5
# Decimals are accepted, so you can start 30 minutes ago, too
$ scrape-versionista --after 0.5
```


## Other Scripts

The `bin` directory contains several other scripts besides `scrape-versionista`. They’re all closely related and perform helper tasks that are important in EDGI’s workflow around Versionista. **You can use the `--help` option with all of them** to see details about arguments, options, and usage.

- `scrape-versionista-and-email` runs `scrape-versionista`, then compresses the results into a single `.tar.gz` archive and e-mails them to a specified address.

- `scrape-versionista-and-upload` runs `scrape-versionista`, uploads the resulting files to Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, and finally imports them into an instance of [web-monitoring-db][].

- `upload-to-google` uploads a directory’s contents to Google Cloud Storage. (Used as part of `scrape-versionista-and-upload`.)

- `upload-to-s3` uploads a directory’s contents to Amazon S3. (Used as part of `scrape-versionista-and-upload`.)

- `import-to-db` sends the contents of a JSON-stream file listing versions that was generated by `scrape-versionista` to an instance of [web-monitoring-db][]. (Used as part of `scrape-versionista-and-upload`.)

- `query-db-and-email` queries a [web-monitoring-db][] instance for pages that were updated with new versions during a given time frame and e-mails a compressed `.tar.gz` archive of the results to a specified address. Results are CSV files — one per combination of tags specified with the `--group-by` option.

    **NOTE: this will soon be deprecated in favor of [web-monitoring-task-sheets][].**

- `get-versionista-metadata` and `get-versionista-page-chunk` are for advanced usage loading extremely large amounts of data from Versionista. See [`backfilling-data.md`](./backfilling-data.md) for usage instructions.
